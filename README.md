# **Networking and Distributed Systems Labs**  

### **About the Project**  
This is a collaborative project for implementing and documenting **labs for the course "Network System Software and Distributed Systems."** The goal is to create structured and practical solutions for each lab, following modern networking and system programming principles.  

### **Project Structure**   
ðŸ“‚ `docs/` â€“ Includes PDF with lab assignments.  
ðŸ“‚ `server/` â€“ Code for the networking server.  
ðŸ“‚ `client/` â€“ Code for the client-side applications.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Networking & System Programming)  
- **Sockets & TCP/IP**
- **Rich library** (For better terminal UI)  
- **UV package manager** (For managing dependencies)  

### **Setup & Installation**  
Make sure you have **UV** installed. If not, install it:  
```bash  
pip install uv  
```
Then, install all project dependencies with UV:
